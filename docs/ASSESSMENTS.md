import { useAssessments } from '@/hooks/useAssessments';

function MyComponent() {
  const { getLatestAssessments, loading } = useAssessments();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadData() {
      const latest = await getLatestAssessments();
      console.log(latest.phq9); // Latest PHQ-9 result
